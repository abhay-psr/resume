titlesec commands

There are two general commands:

 \titleformat{<command>}[<shape>]{<format>}{<label>}{<sep>}{<before-code>}[<after-code>]

where [<shape>] and [<after-code>] are optional parameters, and:

    <command> is the sectioning command to be redefined: \part, \chapter, \section, \subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph or \subparagraph.
    <shape> is sectioning paragraph shape; possible values are: hang, block, display, runin, leftmargin, rightmargin, drop, wrap and frame.
    <format> is the format to be applied to the title, label, and text; for example \normalfont\Large\bfseries
    <label> specify sectioning label.
    <sep> is the horizontal separation between label and title body and it must be a length and not be empty.
    <before-code> is code preceding the title body.
    <after-code> is code following the title body.

and

 \titlespacing{<command>}{<left>}{<before-sep>}{<after-sep>}

where:

    <left> increases the left margin.
    <before-sep> is the vertical space before the title.
    <after-sep> is the separation between title and non-sectioning text.

the starred version of this command (\titlespacing*) kills the indentation of the paragraph following the title.
